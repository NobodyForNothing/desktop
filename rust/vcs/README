Rust implementation of [git](https://git-scm.com/) inspired by [wyag](https://wyag.thb.lt/).

The project is finished once it supports the following git subcommands:
- git init
- git add
- git remove
- git commit
- git checkout
- git status

A secondary goal of this project is to determine pain points in the
implementation and to find out what abstractions are useful and which aren't in
order to implement a more sophisticated vcs that can be used as a daily driver.
