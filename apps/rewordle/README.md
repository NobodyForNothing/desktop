# rewordle

A reimplementation of the classical wordle game focussing on simplicity and usability.

This implementation shows the input before attempting any slow web requests leading to faster load times. Additionally not having an title screen means that input is possible without clicking through menues.

## Features

- Load todays wordle
- Validate inputed words
- Store current progress between loads

## Getting Started

To build the app normal flutter build commands can be used on all platforms.
